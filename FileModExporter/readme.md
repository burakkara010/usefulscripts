**FileModExporter** is a **Bash script** which exports all files on a certain location based on last modified date

Usage:
1. Go to the desired folder you want to export. (The folder can contain more folders inside as the script will seperate all those folders in the export automatically.)
2. If you're running on linux/mac make the script executable by: chmod +X <scriptpath>
3. Run the script and wait until it finishes with the export
